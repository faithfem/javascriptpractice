// Live coding exercise: Declare a variable of your choice and assign it a string that's
// exactly the same as the variable name, but enclosed in quotation marks so JavaScript recognizes it as a string.
// Then code an alert, specifying the variable, not the string, as the message. Click the Run It button to run your code live.
// Type out the code, don't copy and paste it. If you copy and paste it from the screen showing the correct code, it may not work

var crazyVariable = "crazyVariable";
alert(crazyVariable);
